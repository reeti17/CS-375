# Assignment 1

I like ShaderToy for my site. Especially, while browsing, I liked this example the most, [Link](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4tjGRh).
As someone interested in space, this project immediately caught my attention. Although there were many other fascinating examples, like fire and games, I specifically wanted to look into space-related content. 
The entire process is captivating, from revealing the planet to zooming in on the rocks and then showing the ocean. The level of detail is impressive and exciting.
Overall, I thought the shadertoy website was more prefered for me. I liked looking at the code that was provided.
