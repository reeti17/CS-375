# Project Overview

I want to create an aquarium which will have the fishes swimming in a rectangular tank. I will find models for fish and plants on the internet and do it where the user can view the tank as a whole. I would like to use lighting so it looks like an aquarium or some sort of light in there.

## Week 1
Find models for the aquarium and look for inspiration. Try to get the basic background started.

## Week 2
Add the tank and fish. Try to animate the fishes.

## Week 3
Add lighting effects to display an aquarium. Add plants and any other objects.

## Week 4
Make sure everything works and polish it together.

## Technical Project Requirements
I will use Three.js and JavaScript.
